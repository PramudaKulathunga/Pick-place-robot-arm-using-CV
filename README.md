# ü§ñ Robot Arm Color Sorting System

A computer vision-based system for detecting colored objects and simulating robotic arm pick-and-place operations.

## üéØ Project Overview

This system uses OpenCV for real-time color detection and classification of objects, then simulates a robotic arm that picks detected objects and sorts them into designated drop zones based on their color.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Real-time Color Detection**: Red, Green, Blue object detection using HSV color space
- **Object Tracking**: Stable selection with tolerance-based tracking
- **Robot Arm Simulation**: Complete pick-and-place mission simulation
- **Batch Operations**: Pick all objects or specific colors automatically
- **Performance Metrics**: Track success rates and mission statistics
- **Interactive GUI**: Real-time visualization with comprehensive controls
